Creating a Sudo User:


1. Login as ROOT user to the remote server

2. Add a user

	useradd <username>

3. Generate a Password to the user

	passwd <username>

4. Verify the user

	id <username>

5. In CentOS 8 Linux server all members of the wheel group have sudo access. So all you have to do is append user account to the wheel group using the usermod command command:

	usermod -aG wheel <username>

User account <usernmae> now have sudo privileges. Validate by logging in as <username> user.

6. Logout as root user

7. ssh <>@<Remote Host / IP Address>

8. Trying checking the Sudo access to the user.

	1. id

	2. grep '^<username>' /etc/passwd

	3. grep '^wheel' /etc/group

9. Now try checking the access in other way by editing a file which has permissions only for roon user.

	vi /etc/profile		# This will open the file but prompt as 'Read Only'. Normal user cannot edit this.

	sudo vi /etc/profile # This will allow us to edit the file. But it will ask for user password

Sometimes the needs to run the commands without password for that the below steps need to be followed:

1. Login as <username> user

	ssh <username>@<Hostname / IP Address>

2. Add the USER in the /etc/sudoers file

	sudo vi /etc/sudoers	# This will ask for password for first time

	## Add the below line:

		root	ALL=(ALL)	ALL 				# This line already exists
		centos	ALL=(ALL)	NOPASSWD: ALL		# Add this line

	## Modify this line

		%wheel	ALL=(ALL)	NOPASSWD: ALL		# Just delete the Comment

	# Save the file

3. Logout and Login again to check the sudo access without password prompt
