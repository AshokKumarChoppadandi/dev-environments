PROMETHEUS INSTALLATION STEPS (This is should be installed on seperate node)

1. Download Prometheus from the below link (https://prometheus.io/download/):

	wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.27.0/prometheus-2.27.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

2. Extract Prometheus and store it in /usr/local/

	tar -xzvf prometheus-2.27.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/local

3. Create a soft link

	ln -s /usr/local/prometheus-2.27.0.linux-amd64 /usr/local/prometheus

4. Configure prometheus.yml file read data from jmx_exporter which is running on port 8080. Change the job_name & targets like below

	vi /usr/local/prometheus/prometheus.yml

	# my global config
	global:
	  scrape_interval:     15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.
	  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute.
	  # scrape_timeout is set to the global default (10s).
	
	# Alertmanager configuration
	alerting:
	  alertmanagers:
	  - static_configs:
	    - targets:
	      # - alertmanager:9093
	
	# Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to the global 'evaluation_interval'.
	rule_files:
	  # - "first_rules.yml"
	  # - "second_rules.yml"
	
	# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:
	# Here it's Prometheus itself.
	scrape_configs:
	  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
	  - job_name: 'kafka'
	
	    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
	    # scheme defaults to 'http'.
	
	    static_configs:
	    - targets: [bigdata.cluster.node101:8080, bigdata.cluster.node102:8080, bigdata.cluster.node103:8080]

	scrape_configs:
	  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
	  - job_name: 'zookeeper'
	
	    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
	    # scheme defaults to 'http'.
	
	    static_configs:
	    - targets: [bigdata.cluster.node101:8090, bigdata.cluster.node102:8090, bigdata.cluster.node103:8090]

5. Start Prometheus

	/usr/local/prometheus/prometheus

6. Check the status on Administration Node at localhost:9090

7. If it is working fine then set Prometheus as a Service.

	vi /etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service

	[Unit]
	Description=Prometheus Service
	
	[Service]
	User=root
	Group=root
	ExecStart=/usr/local/prometheus/prometheus --config.file=/usr/local/prometheus/prometheus.yml --storage.tsdb.path=/usr/local/prometheus/data
	SuccessExitStatus=143
	
	[Install]
	WantedBy=multi-user.target

	systemctl daemon-reload

	systemctl start prometheus.service

8. Check at localhost:9090
